# SyntaxViceVersa
I wanted to try design a syntax transpiler and generator with Python placed in the center of attention..

Below is a quick illustration of the architecture and flow of technologies - a mermaid diagram (I'm down to make such designs myself later). As a curious developer, I hope to put my own programming language in the center of this transpiler/generator - now lets begin prototyping!

```mermaid

```
